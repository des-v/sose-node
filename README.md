# NODE + PLANTUML starter Template - Coyotiv - School of Software Engineering 

## Getting started

### PLANTUML

There is a **class.puml** example located in the **architecture** folder.
You can continue editing the file or adding other **.puml** files on that folder too.

If you what to visualize a preview of the **class.puml** file or another **.puml** file on the project, please select the file and on your keyboard press the following keys:
MacOS: **Option + D**
Linux/Windows: **Alt + D**

This will automatically open your browser and will show you live any updates that you make on the file.

### NODE / JS

To run the **index.js** file located under the **root** folder, copy and enter one of the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```
or:

```bash
node index.js
```

To run **index.js** file with nodemon, copy and enter one of the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or:

```bash

```

The **index.js** file, it's already linked with the debugger in your **launch.json**
